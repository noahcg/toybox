## Toybox

### What is this?

This project was started so I could keep track of the books I've read. I decided I would rather build my own app for storing my list instead of looking for a pre-built product.

### How was it built?

This app was built using Vue.js for my front end javascript framework. I used Vuetify as my material design component framework. I also used Firebase for my backend including the database, authentication, storage and hosting.
